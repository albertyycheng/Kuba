## Project Overview

This is an implementation of the **Kuba** board game. For a video showcasing rules and gameplay, please click [here](https://youtu.be/XglqkfzsXYc).
This project started as the portfolio project for a course at Oregon State (CS162 - Intro to Computer Science II).
The course required only a game played in the console. In my free time, I've added a user interface to the game that displays the board
as well as the score.

## Run Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Install the pygame module
3. Open and run the .py file

## Demo

In the gif, two players take turns making moves. The screen is updated after each move.
At the end of the gif, when a player knocks off a red marble, their on-screen scoreboard is updated.
(EDIT: I had to compress the gif, so I apologize for the quality!)
